    content: `
      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p>The shift to remote work has fundamentally changed the cybersecurity landscape. Organizations must adapt their security strategies to protect distributed workforces and cloud-based operations.</p>
        
        <h2>New Threat Vectors</h2>
        <p>Remote work has introduced new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals are eager to exploit. Home networks, personal devices, and unsecured connections create attack surfaces that traditional office-based security models weren't designed to address.</p>
        
        <h3>Zero Trust Architecture</h3>
        <p>The zero trust security model has emerged as a critical framework for remote work security. By assuming no implicit trust and continuously validating every transaction, organizations can maintain security regardless of user location.</p>
        
        <h2>Employee Training and Awareness</h2>
        <p>Human factors remain the weakest link in cybersecurity. Comprehensive training programs that educate employees about phishing, social engineering, and safe computing practices are essential for maintaining security in distributed work environments.</p>
        
        <p>As remote work becomes permanent for many organizations, investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and practices is not just advisableâ€”it's essential for business continuity and data protection.</p>
